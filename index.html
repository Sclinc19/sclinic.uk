                    <p>We provide personalized physiotherapy care at home for older adults, focusing on restoring mobility, preventing falls, and improving quality of life. Each session is tailored based on medical history, strength, balance, and goals.Our approach begins with a comprehensive assessment, including mobility testing, gait analysis, and a review of medical history. Based on this, we develop a safe and progressive exercise plan to improve strength, flexibility, and balance. We also address common geriatric issues such as joint stiffness, postural instability, arthritis, and age-related muscle weakness. Family members are involved throughout the care process to ensure emotional support and adherence to the program. Whether recovering from surgery, illness, or age-related decline, we help elderly individuals stay active and independent in the comfort of their own home.</p>
